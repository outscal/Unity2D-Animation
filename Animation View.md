## 2. Animation View

- This is the place where you can manipulate and edit the animations for your game objects.
- To open the Animation view
    - Go to **Window**Â >Â **Animation**. (Shortcut key-  **CNTRL + 6**)
        
        <p align="center">
            <img alt="animation view" src="./Image/animation_view.png">
        </p>
        

        <p align="center">
            <img alt="animation window" src="./Image/animation_window.png">
        </p>
        

- To work in the animation view, you first need a gameObject in the scene, and in the project panel, you need to have the corresponding clips as assets.
    
    
    <p align="center">
            <img alt="gameObject" src="./Image/gameobject.png">
        </p>

- Select the gameObject (Player) in the Hierarchy Window.
- Now go to Animation View and click create.
    
    
    <p align="center">
            <img alt="create" src="./Image/create.png">
    </p>

- Then, make a separate animation folder to save the â€˜.animâ€™ file. Also, change its name to something meaningful like â€˜Player_idle.animâ€™ and save it.
    
    <p align="center">
            <img alt="idle" src="./Image/idle.png">
    </p>

- You will see the animation window changes to some timelines and keyframes view just like below.
    
    
    <p align="center">
        <img alt="blank animation window" src="./Image/blank_animation.png">
    </p>

- Now, Go to the folder in which you have all the clips of the gameObject for animation. Select all the clips and drag and drop them in the animation window.
- See the video for what happens next.

- Yes, you are right, youâ€™re animation is created for that particular gameObject.
- Create one more animation for the game object and we can go to the next part which is **Animator Window**.
