## What's next

Try to come up with more use cases of applying these playerprefs in game and actually implement them in your own games.

With our character animating, you can start learning the basics on how physics work in Unity and eventually use them to implement player movement - [Unity Physics](https://academy.outscal.com/unity-physics/).
